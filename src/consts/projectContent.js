      "I wrote an AI program to recommend the best cities in America to live in. Cities were optimized between being safe and having favorable economic conditions (low cost of living and high median income). Machine learning was used to estimate unknown cost of living values of cities. Over 2000 cities were looked at.",

Vector images were not used as I wanted to make the calculator easier to be built upon in the future. The entire webpage is very small and takes up 14Kb.",
